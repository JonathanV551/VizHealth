# VizHealth 📊💡

**VizHealth** is an iOS application developed in Swift (Xcode) as part of my Independent Study and Mentorship (ISM) project. The goal is to make healthcare data more understandable through meaningful, interactive data visualizations—powered by machine learning and Python.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualizes data from a public health-related CSV dataset
- Uses `pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing
- Integrates a Transformer model (via Python) for analytical insight
- Built with SwiftUI for a modern, intuitive UI
- Standalone iOS app with smooth chart rendering and user interaction

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** – front-end iOS development
- **Xcode** – development environment
- **Python** – for backend data processing
- **pandas** – data wrangling and transformation
- **Transformers** – for ML-based data analysis
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used)** – for graph generation (update if applicable)

## 📁 Dataset

This app uses a public CSV dataset containing health-related data. Users can load the dataset, process it through a backend ML pipeline, and view the results as visual charts.

> Add the dataset source here (e.g., CDC, WHO, Kaggle, etc.)

## 📱 Screenshots

> Include 1–3 screenshots or a short demo GIF here to show what the app looks like.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JonathanV551/VizHealth.git
Open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode

Make sure Python + required libraries are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas transformers
Run the app on an iOS simulator or physical device

📈 Future Improvements
Add filtering and drill-down options for deeper data exploration

Allow users to upload their own CSV files

Expand the Transformer model's role in data prediction or classification

Improve UI with animations and better chart interaction

Add local storage or cloud sync options
