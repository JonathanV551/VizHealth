# VizHealth 📊💡

**VizHealth** is an iOS application developed in Swift (Xcode) as part of my Independent Study and Mentorship (ISM) project. The goal is to make healthcare data more understandable through meaningful, interactive data visualizations—powered by machine learning and Python.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualizes data from a public health-related CSV dataset
- Uses `pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing
- Integrates a Transformer model (via Python) for analytical insight
- Built with SwiftUI for a modern, intuitive UI
- Standalone iOS app with smooth chart rendering and user interaction

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** – front-end iOS development
- **Xcode** – development environment
- **Python** – for backend data processing
- **pandas** – data wrangling and transformation
- **Transformers** – for ML-based data analysis
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used)** – for graph generation (update if applicable)

## 📁 Dataset

This app uses a public CSV dataset containing health-related data. Users can load the dataset, process it through a backend ML pipeline, and view the results as visual charts.
